## Multi-Model Hotel Sentiment Analysis

This project powers a FastAPI web app that compares three sentiment analysis models on hotel reviews: a simple LSTM, a stacked LSTM, and a fine-tuned BERT classifier. Users can submit individual reviews or upload CSV files to see predictions and accuracy side by side. Supporting scripts cover data preparation, model training, and artifact management, while the API serves both interactive pages and prediction endpoints.

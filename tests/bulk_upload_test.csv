4,Good hotel for a one night stay
5,"We travel to Sedona for one week every year and have tried a number of luxury hotels (including L'Auberge). This is now our favorite!! We had a 2 bedroom creekside condo. The bottom floor had a large living room with a pull-out couch (and room darkening shades) and a large TV, full kitchen and half bath. There was also a... More"
5,"The Maxwell Hotel was a great find. The room, the staff, the location were all wonderful. It is not in the center of the city, so there is no outside noise. However, there is free shuttle service to downtown, Pike Market, etc.It is in walking distance to many good restaurants and the Space Needle complex. The staff is very friendly... More"
3,"part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty)."
5,Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Even with outside temps around 40's the pool area was in the 70's and water was relaxing. and of course those late evening cookies are a nice touch as well. Breakfast was always ready at 6:00 and also has those Breakfasts To-Go-Bags if youre in a hurry.
4,We really enjoyed our week! The beach does have erosion but still so beautiful. Our unit was in building 6. We loved the pool and staff was super friendly. We used the complimentary bikes one day and liked them a lot. Loads of food options. Only drawback was that they've implemented some sort of room temperature control so you can't... More
2,"Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out."
5,"Stayed here for a week before boarding the Carnival Glory - it was amazing - room was SO comfortable!! Really really enjoyed ourselves - towel animals each evening and chocolates on the pillow were a lovely touch! Visited in October, hotel wasn't very busy which we liked. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice and whenever I couldn't finish... More"
5,"Within walking distance of major attractions.Rooms were clean and comfortable.Breakfast was simply delicious.The highlight for our family was how friendly all the staff were.Would stay there in a heartbeat.We went to the zoo and it started to pour,one of the desk ladies lent us her own umbrella,just blew us away."
5,I had issues with every hotel I stayed at this week. Plus the traffic in Springfield stinks. I picked this hotel because it was in a small town not far from my first stop the next day. Room was fine it was quiet bed comfortable. Breakfast was ok. I'll stay here when I have to work the... More
4,The room had a funny smell and also dirt around the mirrors and stains on the sheets. The microwave also didn't work. Besides this it's a nice hotel And a great location. Oh and late check is only an extra 30 minutes not an hour.
5,"I loved this hotel! Got in late to find the room lights and tv on! It was great, I didn't have to drag my bags into a dark room and find the lights. So, comfortable, great sleep and oh man great shower!!"
4,It's too bad there's no continental breakfast. But the room was suprisingly comfortable for the price.
5,"Bad: No microwave in room. Good: Bed extremely comfortable professional staff, extra clean. Great place. Also liked the 24-hour Starbucks."
5,Great getaway
1,"We had to quickly find a hotel late at night, after coming to town for a family emergency. Super 8 had room, and so we went ahead and got a room there. The woman at the front desk gave us our key and told us the room number. The exterior of the hotel isn't the best, but I wasn't too... More"
3,"I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing."
5,i like and im going back ::)
5,"My stay was very short with actually only being a night sleep and catch an early flight however the room was clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful."
5,Good no frills room. Quiet cheap and convienent location. I'll return.
3,The front desk hassled my wife for a credit card - while they already had my Marriott Visa card on file with the room already charged to it. They put us in a room next to the elevator and I couldn't get on the elevator (carrying three bags) because the help cut in front of me to take their cart... More
5,"We called last minute after staying in a cabin that was not very good. They were able to set us up in a queen suite just as big as the cabin and much much cleaner! Love the friendliness of the staff! Would recommend to all friends and family! Plus, this was much cheaper then the cabin. We will stay here... More"
2,"I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday."
2,You get what you pay for. I will leave it at that.
4,We enjoyed the food very much and our server was great. Lasagne was special. No push to order wine. We had enough earlier. Nice atmosphere.
1,"I am not sure who wrote the reviews on this place nor when they were written. evidently they have not been there recently. The outside looks very good but, beware! The man at the register was unhappy and it showed. The rooms he assigned us had not been cleaned, beds unmade and had a horrendous odor. The swimming pool was... More"
4,"I have stayed at this property many times and they consistently meet expectations. The hotel in centrally located next to the Consol Arena. A short walk to downtown buildings and Duquesne University. Hop in a car and you are a few minutes from the Strip District, South Side, stadiums and museums. This hotel is up to the Marriott standards. The... More"
5,"My family of four plus our best behaved child, Boston Terrier, stayed here on 6/20/16-6/22/16 and loved our stay. In fact, this hotel was the highlight of a week long driving trip through NC. The employees were warm and friendly, especially Ms. Kim. She was very sweet to my kids and answered all of our questions. Kim gave great suggestions... More"
5,"As a traveling superintendent ,I was there for two weeks and had a great stay, the breakfast was a nice bonus , liked that they had a to go breakfast available , and the coffee was good, referred a business associate to stay there he will be staying for 60+ days also"
4.8,Bad: Can't think of anything. Good: The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious.
2,"To be honest, at 52.78 (including tax) this was a good value for the money. The rooms are fairly clean (ish) and are a good size. However, there is an underlying 'funky' smell that is everywhere - from the lobby to the rooms. When I laid down for the night the smell was not sleep inspiring to say the least.... More"
5,We were glad to find a great place for a great price. We even got out for a walk after our flight and found the area to be safe and easy to walk around. The people were nice and the breakfast decent. We'd definitely recommend it.
5,"This hotel has a historic, mixed with modern ambiance. It's a few blocks from the Illinois River with restaurants and the Spirit of Peoria riverboat. The staff was so nice and breakfast was wonderful. The bar had great entertainment too......,...................."
4,"For a very small town out in the middle of nowhere, you will not find anything better. In fact, it is above average, even compared with its big city counterparts. Clean, well-maintained and comfortable. That's all we ask. The breakfast was the weakest link, but that has become standard for pretty much every place that offers the routine continental fare."
5,"We always stay at this hotel when visiting New Orleans. It is literally steps from some of the classic restaurants in New Orleans and close to Bourbon Street while still allowing for a good night's sleep. The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. I recommend the larger rooms over the smaller ones, since the small rooms are really... More"
4,"Great location to the beach and boardwalk. Nice to have a kitchen. Would have liked to have stayed for a few more days. Try to get an inside room. Though we did have a slice of the ocean view, the lights of the business on the other side of the alley was on all night."
5,"Easy access location (pretty easy from BWI and rental car facility too), great shopping very close, excellent complimentary breakfast, has great bed and pillows (imho). Great value for price in this area."
4,"Except for highway noise, our room was fine. The followup customer service w was exceptional I'd left my purse behind and was 6 hours away when I discovered it missing. Mr Patel went out of his way to get it to me the next day. THANK YOU!"
4.15,Bad: Buffet food.
5,"This is an older property which reminded me of the ski lodges that you see in movies. The views were wonderful filled with fall leaves. The lobby had a fireplace and comfortable, cushy furniture. Wine and cheese was available in the lobby in the late afternoon. The rooms were spacious, and had all the amenities. Though not new, they were... More"
5,The location was great. It was my first time stay at a hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room was fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay here. Thank you to the staff for making my stay enjoyable
3,"Stay was good though parking a work vehicle is not practical. Main parking tight and deck is 7 max height, thought better height than others on beach."
5,"We close on our house downtown, and needed a place to stay after the move. I really didn't have that much time at the hotel,because I was in late, and out early. My wife had more time, and really enjoyed it. I wish they served coffee before 6:30"
1,"In a word - awful. Called early in the day to ask for a late check in lady was very sassy and snarky rather than just making a note on the reservation. Once actually checked in: room extremely tiny, AC unit very loud, bed uncomfortable. Housekeeping knocked at 8am to clean room - checkout wasn't until 10am..."
5,Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.
5,This is a nice family owned hotel. It is well appointed but not luxury. The service was exceptional. They could teach a course in hotel service. The staff introduced themselves and remembered our name.
4,"This was our first stay at a Home 2 Suites hotel. The hotel was very modern, clean, and well kept. The entire staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. The breakfast serving area could have been a little bigger to accommodate all of the individuals who were dining at the same time."
5,"The staff was friendly, professional and helpful. The accommodations were clean and convenient to all the local attractions."
5,"Hotel staff has been very accommodating and making my stay a wonderful one. They have went out of their way to ensure the smallest details are taken care of, just to make my stay more comfortable. The Paradise restaurant and lounge is second to none here in Moses Lake. Everyone is so friendly and courteous, especially Lisbeth. I recommend going... More"
5,"We arrived at Pebble Beach following a scenic (if challenging) drive north through Big Sur from Cambria and the Hearst Castle along Californias famous curvy, coastal Hwy 1. Awaiting us as we drive in to the ground at Pebble Beachwas Greg (pictured). Seeing Greg with his raised, welcoming arms at the main entrance to the Lodge signaled that we had... More"
